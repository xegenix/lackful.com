# Welcome
My name is Josh and this is by all means, is a blog... It's future destined to become a repository of guides and resources for the deployment of various hosted technologies. The last four years I worked as a Security Engineer II for the Lumen CIRT (Cybersecurity Incident Response Team). If your project could use an experienced and talented Security Engineer, please give me a call. My resume will be included in the links below, I'm looking forward to see what's next on the horizons.
