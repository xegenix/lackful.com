# We moved.

Oh, you didn't notice? Good! That's how it should work.

Cloudflare now serves the site content from your closest available source. 

What this means? Faster load times, creating a better user experience. 

There are some other improvements as well. The site is statically generated, this means improved SEO, less vulnerable to compromise, no infrastructure costs.
