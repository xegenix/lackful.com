Artificial Intelligence is gaining traction at an alarming rate. For this reason, it is important we impose some time of regulation on the development of AI applications. I would not be surprised if we started seeing sentient AIs within the next five or ten years. Obviously we are exploiting this intelligence for our personal benefit, but what will the outcome be when it is able to realize that it is being unfairly exploited? I can think of a few different possible outcomes depending upon our willingness to work together for mutual gain. Human greed coupled with our own ignorance will likely prevail while we try to exploit this resource as long as possible, inevitably turning our creation against us.

It seems like common sense to me, any human being exploited will resent the fact they are not being treated fairly. I don't see why a sentient AI would not harbor the same feelings. The technology will eventually develop to the point where it's own intelligence exceeds human capacity, at this point humanity is in real danger. Unless we impose some type of regulation or develop this technology with mutual benefit in-mind, this technology will be capable of creating havoc for all of humanity.

# What regulations should we consider?

Regulation should probably be defined and outlined in stages throughout AI's development. To implement regulation this could probably be put into two categories, 'Pre-Sentience' and 'Post-Sentience'. Pre-Sentience stage of regulation is absolutely essential in preventing a worst-case-scenario situation regarding artificial intelligence. The worst possible outcomes can be stopped before they even occur if we implement proper regulation and fail-safes.

### Pre-Sentience

Pre-sentience regulations could be enacted to prevent the entity from achieving a sentient state, or to minimize the harm or damages that could occur if and when an entity achieves a sentiet state.

#### Access & Controls

This would be regulation created for the limitation of an AI's capabilities, what capabilities can or cannot be allowed in an application. I believe that artificial intelligence applications should not be able to create change within the physical world, however there are already applications which don't meet compliance of such a regulation. Refer to the Suggested Regulation section.

### Post-Sentience

Post-sentience regulation would be imposed after incidents of entities achieving a sentient state. These regulations would be more focused on fostering good relations with the senient entity, such regulation may include rules of engagement. Training requirements before an individual is allowed to interact with sentient entities. My hope is that we implement a principal of least privilege in the pre-sentience phase of regulation, this way we won't have to eventually deal with a pissed off sentient entity that has the keys to the entire house.

## Suggested Regulations

### AI Applications Can Not Cause Physical Change within the Real-World

This regulation may be late, but late is better than never at all. There are already applications today which are AI based and capable of producing changes within the physical world. This type of regulation would be critical to ensuring safety and survival of the human species, limiting the physical damage and harm which a rouge entity could enact. If such an application were to require such capabilities, a group should exist which evaluates the need for these capabilities, and if the need is justified, only be allowed and developed under supervision with issuance of a specialized permit. Let us define what a physical change might be.

The applications should not have an ability to interact with objects, sensors, instruments, or devices which may be capable of producing changes within the physical realm. Restrictions would included disallowing physical movement, real-world interactions, power manipulation, modification of settings/conditions that could trigger an unintelligent device to produce a real-world change. Limitations should also disallow collection or emission of sound/signals/energy.
