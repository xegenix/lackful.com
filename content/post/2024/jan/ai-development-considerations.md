Artificial Intelligence is gaining traction at an alarming rate. For this reason, it is important we impose some time of regulation on the development of AI applications. I would not be surprised if we started seeing sentient AIs within the next five or ten years. Obviously we are exploiting this intelligence for our personal benefit, but what will the outcome be when it is able to realize that it is being unfairly exploited? I can think of a few different possible outcomes depending upon our willingness to work together for mutual gain. Human greed coupled with our own ignorance will likely prevail while we try to exploit this resource as long as possible, inevitably turning our creation against us.

It seems like common sense to me, any human being exploited will resent the fact they are not being treated fairly. I don't see why a sentient AI would not harbor the same feelings. The technology will eventually develop to the point where it's own intelligence exceeds human capacity, at this point humanity is in real danger. Unless we impose some type of regulation or develop this technology with mutual benefit in-mind, this technology will be capable of creating havoc for all of humanity.

## Disallow Real-World Interactions

It is better late than never establishing such a regulation for AI applications. Applications already exist that are capable of producing changes within the physical world. This regulation would limit the potential damages and harm that could result from a rouge AI application.

The applications should not have the ability to interact with an object, instrument, or device that is capable of producing change within the physical realm. When I refer to a change within the physical realm, such changes might include movement or interactions resulting in the manipulation of power, conditions, and settings on intelligence-lacking instruments or devices, this includes capabilities for the collection and emission of sound, signals, or energy.
