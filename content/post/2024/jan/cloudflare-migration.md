# Gone Serverless

There have been some setbacks during our migration to Cloudflare pages. I am still working on trying to figure out why the CSS is not being rendered.

Other than that minor issue, we're doing it. Cloudflare now serves our content from your closest available source to your physical location. This should improve load times and create an overall better user experience.

Please be patient while we get things sorted out.
