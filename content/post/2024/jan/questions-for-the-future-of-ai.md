We are developing artificial intelligence at an alarming rate, we need to establish some time of guidance for responsible AI development.

## Physical Interaction

Unfortunately I believe there are already AI applications operating in the world which are capable of creating change to the physical world. So, what access control mechanisms can we establish to limit the potential for misuse by a rouge artificial intelligence.

If any regulation is possible, I suggest that no application should have the ability to interact with an object/device capable of producing change to the physical world. When I refer to a change within the physical world, such examples would include any form of movement or interaction allowing the manipulation of power, conditions, or settings on change-capable (unintelligent) instruments/devices, including the collection or emission of sound, signals, or energy.
