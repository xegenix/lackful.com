# Introduction 

We're open to the public so I guess I might as well introduce myself. Joshua Marcum here, and until very recently I was a Security Engineer for a global network communications provider's cybersecurity incident response team. I've always held an interest in trying to understand server technology, this obsession started at age ten when I created my first website. This decision started a chain reaction. I decided free hosting was not good enough, I needed a domain, and then now some place to host my site. I realized hope of was lost of recovering from my binge of geekdom, especially after discovering UNIX based operating systems. I put my parent's hard-earned money to work, new distributions were being delivered weekly by mail. By mail? YES. My attempt to download it would have taken far longer. That and I had better odds of being a lottery winner then pulling off a 600mb uncorrupted ISO file on dial-up.

I started my first technical job working for the Help Desk of a mostly-Windows based hosting provider. I gained a good portion of my nix admin experience here, we had a farm of Zimbra-based mail servers. Oh those were fun, anyhow the company provided shared hosting, dedicated (managed, and unmanaged), and we eventually moved into virtual private server offerings. My career has steadily progressed through the various roles in systems administration, engineering, devops, and eventually in the realm of security.

My company was generous enough to gift 1,199 others and myself time-off for the holidays, indefinitely. Thanks Lumen Technologies! 

The worst part, I am not likely find another remote job working overnight. It was a great fit for my family and a good way to beat the Phoenix heat during summers. Odd fact, I've worked nights for almost 13 years now.  

My challenge is finding a job without a degree. I never went to college, technology has been my life since the age of eight. I know my field, and I have worked for some of the largest enterprise-class organizations. I have plenty of professional experience, and I am sure that I'll find something, but it takes much longer without that degree. If I can get an interview, I can usually get the job except, many employers won't even interview you without the degree. If you have ever wondered if a degree is worth it or even essential in today's job market... it is, absolutely. That degree makes landing jobs much easier, it makes you more desirable as an employee.

Enough drama, welcome to the site. Please be sure to check back soon for more server technology & security-centric content. May kindness and opportunities for knowledge fill your day.
